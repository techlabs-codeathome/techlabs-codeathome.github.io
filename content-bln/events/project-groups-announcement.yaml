  In this session, we'll announce all selected projects and their respective team members. You'll also meet your mentors and get the chance to have your first meeting in project-based breakout rooms. This will be a great opportunity not only to introduce yourselves to each other, but also to discuss next steps and actually kickstart your project.

  We'll also give you some pointers about how to get started and what should you pay attention to next.
