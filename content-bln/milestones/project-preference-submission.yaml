  After seeing all the pitches by your fellow Techies, you'll need to submit your TOP 3 preferences (in no particular order). We'll then assemble the team the best way possible, trying our best to respect your preferences.

  Please keep in mind: **failure to send your project preferences will result in the removal from the program**.
