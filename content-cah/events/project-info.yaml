  This session will provide you with all information you need to enter and complete the Project Phase.

  We'll get into details about the course of the project and a presentation about "Agile Project Management". Further we will have some project pitches where chosen groups are able to present their project idea and get feedback from our mentors and your fellow Techies.
  
  Lastly, we invite you to our Breakout Session with seperate rooms for the distinct track. Here you are able to ask your mentor remaining questions about your track and project.
