  This event takes place on the 22nd September at 8 pm CEST.
  Our WebDev mentor invites you to the first Web Development Live-Coding event.
  Here, you will have the opportunity to code along with the mentor and get a first glimpse on how to start off a new coding project by applying your newly learned skills.

  In the first event, the main focus will be HTML and CSS, which you should have completed in the online learning by now (25% milestone).

  The resulting state will be our starting point for the second WebDev live-coding event. In case you are not able to join the first meeting, but want to participate in the consequent event, the project files will be available afterwards here.
