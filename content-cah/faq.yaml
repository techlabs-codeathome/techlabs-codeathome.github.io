        Please check out our **[#codeathome Program Guide](https://www.notion.so/techlabs/Program-Guide-1ef441c0ba41490aab4ba502297c62fc)** for step-by-step guidelines on how to sign up. Always use the same email for all our tools!

        We only offer the following tracks on edyoucated:

        - **TechLabs | UX | 2021**
        - **TechLabs | Web Development | 2021**
        
        We do not offer Data Science with R in our remote program!
    - title: Am I supposed to receive a personalized track? Why is there a survey?
      content: |
        For the #codeathome Bootcamp, we don't offer any tailored tracks due to the intense and relatively short learning phase. Thus, you don't have to fill out the edyoucated survey.

        You can just select between the four different tracks (Web Development, UX/UI, Data Science with Python, and AI). Personalized tracks are only offered in our the local Digital Shaper programs, to fill out the survey is only needed there.
    - title: When should I start working on the online courses? Are there any fix lessons? 
      content: |
        We recommend to start as early as possible to be able to finish your track in approximately 6 weeks, in order to have enough time to work on your project. 
        
        **There aren't any regular lessons**, you have full flexibility and control over your learning time and can decide when you want to work on your learning track(s).
    - title: Is there a Deadline to complete the tracks? 
      content: |
        You have to **complete at least 75% of your online-learning track(s)** by the 
        **31st of November** to get a certificate.
    - title: How much time do I have to study?
      content: |
        We recommend to study 6-10 hours per week on your track. However, maybe you need some more time to exercise or to do some additional tasks. 
    - title: Is it possible to do more than one track within the nine weeks? 
      content: |
        Theoretically, you can do all four tracks if you have enough time. However, we recommend **focusing on one track at a time** in order to deepen your knowledge and understanding of the topic.

    - title: Why do I had to choose a main track? I thought I could study more than one track? 
      content: |
        We want you to focus on one field of study at a time. Thus, you have to decide which track you want to fucuse on: This is your Main Track. Within the 9 weeks of our bootcamp you have to complete your main track to get our official bootcamp certificate. Furthermore, you will be paired by us with 3-5 other Techies studying the same main track as you (Your TrackStudy-Buddy group and future project group).
        
        If you are not happy with your initial Main Track selection, you can change your Main Track within the first Week and by filling out our Bootcamp Check-In form.
        
        Theoretically, you can study more than one track, if you have enough time. On our plattform edcoucated you can learn all other available tracks, next to your main track. However, it is not possible to tackle two or more projects within our bootcamp. 
    - title: Are the Tracks still accessible after the nine weeks?
      content: |
        Yes, you will have access to edyoucated after the #codeathome Bootcamp. But you will only receive the official bootcamp certificate if you have finished your online-learning track(s) by the **31st of October**.  
    - title: Will I get a certificate for each track?
      content: |
        You will get a certificate for **each completed track (75%)**. Also you have to hand in **one solution with your project team** - not one for each track, just one for all!
