  This event takes place on the 6th September at 8 pm CEST.

  In our first Workshop we will show you how to set-up your **Python** development environment to get you started. The set-up workshop will focus on the first steps in using Python for Data Science.

  We **strongly recommend** to attend this session, especially if you are new to the field of data science. We really want to give you the best experience for the learning as well as the project work.
