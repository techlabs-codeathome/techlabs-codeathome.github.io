    questions:
    - title: Introduction
      content: |
        Online learning does not unfold its full potential in isolation. We all need a social context in which we can share what we have learned and help each other out. Furthermore, we need the dynamics of a community to make sure that everyone stays on track. To keep you motivated, we will invite you into our global community and connect you with like-minded people. Apart from offering you a platform to exchange your learning experiences and discuss difficulties, we also host various online meeting formats and events during the program.
        We highly recommend to use our community and be an active part of it.

        Stay up to date with our [**Semester Radar Timeline**](https://codeathome.techlabs.org/timeline)! All events, milestones, presentations and a FAQ can be found here:
