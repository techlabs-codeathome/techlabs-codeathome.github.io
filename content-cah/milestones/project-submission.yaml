description: |
  You did some nice work and now is the time to show it off! After you've finished your implementation, you will officially submit your project to us for review.
  You must have completed at least __75%__ of your learning material by this date as well. This __is__ a cutting point, as you will only get your certificate, if you completed 75% of the learning track in addition to the project work.
  
  In addition, we would like you to submit a **link to your GitHub repository** along with a *README* which outlines what steps are needed to operate the prototype. Please include the a **Short Project Description** as *Markdown* file in the repository.

  The Project Submission Form must be submitted **once per team member**.
