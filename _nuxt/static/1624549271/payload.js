Git (& our used online service GitHub) is designed in a way that multiple people can work on a project at the same time easily.\n\nWe **strongly recommend** to attend this session, to be able to use Git, since TechLabs requires the usage of Git from all Techies during the project phase. It will be an interactive workshop of 3h.\n\nWe really want to give you the best experience for learning Git, so we put in the effort to create an interactive workshop, where we will teach you the skills and then give you the chance to practice them in breakout rooms guided by our mentors.
